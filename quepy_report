Introduction: Quepy is a python framework to transform natural language questions to queries in a database query language. It can be easily customized to different kinds of questions in natural language and database queries. So, with little coding you can build your own system for natural language access to your database.

Notes: 
**1.) Built in support only for Sparql and MQL. 
It is possible to convert spqrql and MQL queries to SQL queries. But, there are some shortcomings. For instance, in sparql, the join mechanism is completely different from the Relational tables. So, this could be a challenge for us.
